# Mood & Rant Tracker

A React-based web application for tracking daily moods and personal reflections. This project allows users to log their moods and write more detailed journal entries or "rants" about their day. Perfect for anyone who wants to maintain a digital diary for self-expression and self-reflection.

## Features

### Mood Tracker
- **Quick Mood Entry**: Users can quickly log a mood (e.g., ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜¢, etc.) and a short reflection to capture the day's feeling.
- **Mood History**: Entries are displayed in a list format with the newest moods at the top, allowing users to easily browse through past moods.

### Rant Journal
- **Detailed Reflections**: The Rant Journal section enables users to write longer entries, adding more detail and context to their reflections.
- **Mood Selection for Entries**: Users can tag each rant entry with a mood (e.g., ðŸ˜Š Happy, ðŸ˜” Sad, ðŸ˜¡ Angry) to capture the tone of the entry.
- **Entry Date**: Each entry is automatically timestamped with the date it was created.
